Homework 2: 3D Game
Romy Aboudarham 

I wrote an interactive 3D demo with WebGL with the following features:

1. Avatar -The user is able to move a vehicle or character (the avatar) with the keyboard and/or the mouse. (move along xz axis using arrow keys, up and down y using Q and E.)

2. Sunshine - A single non-vertical directional light source illuminates the game world.

3. Highlander - one object has diffuse (Lambertian) shading

4. Shining - one object with specular (diffuse + Phong-Blinn) shading

5. Spotlight - one point light source fixed to the avatar. The point light should is not isotropic, but emits the largest intensity of light along a main direction, and fall off for directions further away from it. The spotlight moves along with the avatar as it moves and rotates.

6. The Matrix Revolutions -The avatar has at one rotating part (propeller).

7. Ground Zero - There is a large ground plane with some tileable texture repeated on it indefinitely.

8. Pitch Black -Shadows of objects appear on the ground to give a sense of altitude (or the lack of it). 

9. Keep Watching - Implemented a helicam. The camera always looks at the avatar and the distance from the avatar needs to be kept reasonably constant.

10. Marble Texturing- one object has procedural solid texturing (marble)
